# Sly Cooper Decompilation Docs

This branch contains the documentation for the Sly Cooper Decompilation Project. The docs are generated automatically from the codebase using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html). It is hosted on GitHub Pages at [theonlyzac.github.io/sly1](https://theonlyzac.github.io/sly1/).


## Generating Docs

**Requirements**: doxygen, graphviz

Clone the repo and run the `generate.sh` script. This will generate the documentation in the `html` directory. You can open `html/index.html` in your browser to preview the documentation.


## Contributing

If you find any errors in the documentation, please [open an issue](https://github.com/theonlyzac/sly1/issues/new) or make a pull request on the [main branch](https://github.com/theonlyzac/sly1) to address it directly.

If you are making a pull request to update the documentation files on this branch, don't forget to `git add` the `html` directory before pushing.
